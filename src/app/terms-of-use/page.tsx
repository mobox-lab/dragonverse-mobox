          Losses while digital assets are being supplied to the $MDBL LBP Launch Site and losses due to the fluctuation of
          prices of tokens in a transaction pair or liquidity pool. Prices of digital assets fluctuate day by day or even minute
          by minute. The value of your available balance could surge or drop suddenly. Please note that there is a possibility
          that the price of tokens could decrease to zero. Prices of tokens are prone to significant fluctuations, for example,
          due to announced proposed legislative acts, governmental restrictions, news related to cyber crimes or other factors
          causing potentially excessive market enthusiasm, disproportionate loss in confidence, or manipulation by others in the

          Risks associated with accessing the $MDBL LBP Launch Site through third party web or mobile interfaces. You are

        <li>Risks associated with any Smart Contracts with which you interact.</li>
        <li>
          Although $MDBL LBP Launch Site does not have access to your assets, you are reminded and acknowledge that at any time,
          your access to your Cryptocurrency Assets through third party wallet services, unrelated to $MDBL LBP Launch Site, may
          be suspended or terminated or there may be a delay in your access or use of your Cryptocurrency Assets, which may
          result in the Cryptocurrency Assets diminishing in value or you being unable to complete a Smart Contract.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are reminded of the inherent risks with digital assets and decentralized finance including the fact that tokens
          are not legal tender and are not backed by any government. Unlike fiat currencies, which are regulated and backed by
          local governments and central banks, tokens are based only on technology and user consensus, which means that in cases
          of manipulations or market panic, central governments will not take any corrective actions or measures to achieve
          stability, maintain liquidity or protect their value. There is a possibility that certain transactions cannot be
          settled or may be difficult to settle, or can be completed only at significantly adverse prices depending on the
          market situation and/or market volume. Transactions may be irreversible, and, accordingly, potential losses due to
          fraudulent or accidental transactions are not recoverable. Some blockchain transactions are deemed to be completed
          when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time when you or another party initiated the
          transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          The regulatory frameworks applicable to blockchain transactions in connection with tokens are still developing and
          evolving. It is possible that your transactions or funds are, or may be in the future, subject to various reporting,
          tax or other liabilities and obligations. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the country or
          international level may materially and adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of your tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          The site and/or application may be wholly or partially suspended or terminated for any or no reason, which may limit
          your access to your Cryptocurrency Assets.

          well as reporting and disclosure obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          This list of risk factors is non-exhaustive, and other risks, arising either now or in the future, could additionally
